# WIP_IOT_Farm
This is a masters degree project (more like an activity or something like that, not a final project) in the technology education field for 16-18 yo students. 

Sorry for the messy structure, is intended to be used as a example.
It uses AdafruitIO platform as a monitoring and control center. 
Hope you find files somewhat useful for your projects. Its a simple project. 

I added a photos folder as a lazy manual. Its a WIP for now anyways.
